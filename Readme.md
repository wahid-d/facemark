# Face Analysis using Facial Landmarks


## Guidelines

### `git control`
---
- clone or fork the repository
- pull `dev` branch and make a new branch for each feature out of `dev` branch always
- before starting a new branch, always make sure that you branch off from `dev` and your `dev` is up-to-date with remote
- branch naming should follow this rule: ***`yourName`***`/feature/`***`featureName`***
  
  ex: `david/feature/camere-set-up`

- never push changes to `dev` or `master` branch. always push to a local branch and make a `PULL REQUEST`


### `ai project`
---
- cooperate with a team-mate before editing files. If you work on the same file at the same time, there will be a merge conflict.
- team-mates who are working on AI project should work together and add tasks to issues tab if necessary

### `mobile project`
---
- if there is any issue, open a new issue on issues tab and leave some comment.
